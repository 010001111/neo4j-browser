          | There are two kinds of Bolt drivers specified by URI scheme: the 'bolt://' scheme is used to create a direct driver and the 'bolt+routing://' scheme is used to create a routing driver.
          | In Neo4j Browser, the bolt+routing setting is used to control which driver should be used. However it is not always appropriate for Neo4j Browser to use a routing driver even when bolt+routing is on.

          | Neo4J Browser will always:

              b direct&nbsp;
              | driver to populate sysinfo and the member specific items in the information panel e.g. version, cluster role etc
        p
          | If bolt+routing is on and the provided URI points to a Causal Cluster member Neo4J Browser will:

              | use a&nbsp;

              | use a&nbsp;
              b routing&nbsp;
              | driver to populate the metadata (labels, relationship types, properties) in the information panel.
        p
          | If bolt+routing is off or the provided URI does not point to a Causal Cluster member Neo4J Browser will:
