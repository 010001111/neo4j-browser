        p
          | Because of how web browsers handle (self signed) certificates
          | the web browser needs to go to a HTTPS URL and accept / permanently
          | trust the certificate before a secure Bolt connection to the server can be
          | created.
        p
          | By default Neo4j offers a HTTPS URL on&nbsp;
          a(href="https://localhost:7473") https://localhost:7473
          | .
        p
          | You will need to manually view (usually by clicking in a broken padlock in
          | the address bar) and trust the certificate to be able to create a secure connection.
