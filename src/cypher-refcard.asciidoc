= Neo4j Cypher Refcard =

*Cypher is the declarative query language for Neo4j, the worldâ€™s leading graph database.*

* Cypher matches patterns of nodes and relationship in the graph, to extract information or modify the data.
* Cypher has the concept of identifiers which denote named, bound elements and parameters. 
* Cypher can create, update, and remove nodes, relationships, and properties. 

You can try cypher snippets live in the Neo4j Console at http://console.neo4j.org.
