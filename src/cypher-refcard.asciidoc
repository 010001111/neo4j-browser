= Neo4j Cypher Refcard {neo4j-version} =

*Cypher is the declarative query language for Neo4j, the world’s leading graph database.*

Key principles and capabilities of Cypher are as follows:

* Cypher matches patterns of nodes and relationship in the graph, to extract information or modify the data.
* Cypher has the concept of identifiers which denote named, bound elements and parameters.
* Cypher can create, update, and remove nodes, relationships, labels, and properties.
* Cypher manages indexes and constraints.

Note: `{value}` denotes either literals, for ad hoc Cypher queries; or parameters, which is the best practice for applications.

|Performance
| 
* Use parameters instead of literals when possible.
  This allows Cypher to re-use your queries instead of having to parse and build new execution plans.
* Try not to use optional relationships.
  Above all, don't use them like this: `MATCH a-[r?:LOVES]->() WHERE r IS NULL` where you just make sure that they don't exist.
  Instead do this like so: `MATCH a WHERE NOT (a)-[:LOVES]->()`.
* Always set an upper limit for your variable length patterns.
  It's easy to have a query go wild and touch all nodes in a graph by mistake.
* Return only the data you need.
  Avoid returning whole nodes and relationships -- instead, pick the data you need and return only that.

|Deprecation
|
With Neo4j 2.0 several Cypher features have been deprecated or removed.

* +START+ is optional
* Optional relationships are handled by +OPTIONAL MATCH+ not question marks
* Non-existing properties return null, +n.prop?+ and +n.prop!+ have been removed
* Separator for collection functions changed form +:+ to +\|+
* Paths are no longer collections, use +nodes(path)+ or +rels(path)+
* Parentheses around nodes in patterns are no longer optional
* +CREATE a=\{property:’value’\}+ has been removed
* Use +REMOVE+ to remove properties
* Parameters for index-keys and nodes in patterns are no longer allowed
