=== Building ===

.Requirements
* Apache Maven version 3,
* Make,
* Python.

To build, issue this from the command line:

[source]
----
mvn clean package
----

The result will be available in the 'target/html5' directory.

There's also an experimental version optimized for printing.
You can enable it by appending `-Dprint` to the command line.
The result will be available in the 'target/html5-print' directory.
In essence, it shuts off the dynamic layout magic.
Might actually not be a good solution -- we'll see.
