Neo4j - The World's Leading Graph Database
==========================================

Neo4j is the world's leading Graph Database. It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables â€” yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.

Neo4j is an open source product available in a GPLv3 Community edition, with Advanced and Enterprise editions available under both the AGPLv3 and commercial licenses, supported by [Neo Technology](http://neotechnology.com/).

Building Neo4j
--------------

Neo4j is built using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) version 3.

o A plain `mvn clean install` will only build the individual jar files. 

o Test execution is, of course, part of the build.

o To add execution of integration tests, use: `mvn clean install -DrunITs`

o In case you just want the jars, without compiling the tests, this is for you: `mvn clean install -DminimalBuild`

o To build everything, including running all tests, producing documentation and assembling product packages, use `mvn clean install -DfullBuild`

o To build the documentation see the [Neo4j manual](manual)

o When building on Windows, use `-Dlicensing.skip` to avoid problems related to line endings.

o The license header check can be skipped by appending the following to the command line: `-Dlicense.skip=true`

For further details on building, please consult the [community docs](community/README.md).

Licensing
---------

Neo4j can be commercially licensed for non-open source deployments. Please contact [Neo Technology](mailto:sales@neotechnology.com) for more information.
