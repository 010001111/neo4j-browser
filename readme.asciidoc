=== How it works ===

The main file for the content is 'src/cypher-refcard.asciidoc'.
It loads include files created from executing tests against Neo4j.
That's done in the Scala project in the 'neo4j-cypher-refcard-tests' directory,
The tests are located in 'neo4j-cypher-refcard-tests/src/test/scala/org/neo4j/cypher/docgen/refcard'
